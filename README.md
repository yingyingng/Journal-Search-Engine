*Search Engine*

This search engine was designed based on the data structure of the master.json file, which contains information on journals retrieved from the Nanyang Technological University library. These are the basic functions of the search engine:

- Search by first/last name of the author
- Search by name of journal
- Search by title of article
- Search by keyword
- Filter by year (default: all years)
- Filter by number of filter (default: all pages)
- Filter by presence of corresponding author (default: no)

If there are fields that are unknown, you may simply skip it and the default option will be chosen. Let's begin the search!
